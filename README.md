# Data Structures & Algorithms

This is my collection of data structures and algorithms followed by my onw interpretation of the concepts

The languages used are C and C++ but can be followed with any other programming language

Inside a topic directory there could be included some exercises that test the concepts of the topic

## Environment

I used Visual Studio Code with the C/C++ extensions

Compile to exectuable `gcc <program_name>.c -o <program_name>`

Run the executable `./<program_name>`

Note that the first program name has to match the file you are trying to compile. The second program name can be whatever placeholder name you want to assign to that file. Generally, it has the same name.


## Topics

Each topic is organised in its own directory with the notes found in the README file and all executable files

### Introduction
### Recursion
### Array Representations
### Array ADT
### Strings
### Sparse Matrices
### Sparse Matrix and Polynomial Representation
### Linked List
